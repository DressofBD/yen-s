                    Concept studies are at the heart of planning for both onshore and offshore developments. Identification and assessment of development options for facilities,  are crucial in the selection of the most cost effective solution to take forward to the subsequent project phase and to support  investment decisions. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We typically develop optional concepts and present these to our client in a conceptual selection matrix. Then a screening process will be carried out based on concept selection criteria, which WASCO develops in accordance to the Client requirements. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    WASCO’s multi-disciplinary team of engineers will perform process simulations, develop the process schemes, study facilities options to decide optimum facilities flow scheme, develop conceptual plant layout and perform all the associated engineering to support the successful delivery of an economic and technically optimal development concept.   This empowers our client to progress their project into the Front End Engineering Design phase.

                    FEED is an essential part of the project lifecycle after successful option identification and assessment during the concept phase. A robust FEED will deliver not just the final concept to be taken forward into construction, but will also provide the estimate for final sanction together with the documentation for the next contracting phases. Front-end engineering and design is the work required to produce quality process and engineering documentation of sufficient depth, defining the project requirements for detailed engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction of facilities and supporting a ±10 percent project cost estimate.

                    Detailed Engineering primarily converts FEED into construction or production drawings. We employ 3D integrated, multidisciplinary plant design and engineering processes to convert high-level specifications, data sheets, process calculations, and concepts into detailed design documentation. Our multidisciplinary, detailed engineering services encompass process, HSE, rotating equipment, piping, mechanical, civil and structural, instrumentation and controls, electrical, HVAC, construction and procurement, all working in perfect sync with each other.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Detail engineering requires an intensive exchange between all parties involved such as Client, our design engineers, equipment suppliers and Certifying authorities in order to clarify specific design issues and to reach conclusive agreements for timely implementation. As an engineering contractor, we supply all the necessary services, i.e. the entire detail engineering up to mechanical completion and we will also support you during commissioning and plant start-up, if requested. During each and every project we aim to work collaboratively and transparently with you to meet shared goals. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We offer a range of contracting strategies, from reimbursable man-hour projects and discrete detailed design and procurement contracts through to greenfield and  brownfield modification projects. And we will integrate our project development and execution capabilities where schedules dictate.

                    <br>
                    Cost effective engineering centers in Indonesia enable us to drive more cost-competitive solutions without compromising quality, this in turn is supplemented by Singapore leads. This well-established working practice is proven and based on the project and technical leadership being consistent, client-facing and fully accountable.  Our projects are supported by an engaged management team and experienced project managers and directors whose capabilities span the range of engineering disciplines.  With the world plagued with COVID-19 in the last two years, WASCO has developed an Engineering model that allow for the Engineers to work remotely, efficiently and safely from their homes 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We take a construction-led approach to design; this means we design with ease of construction in mind, reducing problems and costs down the line. And the construction management guidelines that govern our construction and commissioning activities ensure that our engineering output is robust and conforms to our high standards. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We offer a balance of resources to support everything from small, modular and fast-track projects through to major developments requiring hundreds of engineers, large supply chains and integrated construction services.

                    Wasco offers a range of solutions designed to eliminate or reduce bottlenecks to maximize productivity in oil and gas facilities. First step in this process is by examining the overall operating conditions of the facility and understanding the limitation of the facility.

                    <br>

                    FPSO Redeployment and MOPU deployment in recent times has been hugely successful in reaching first oil/enhanced oil recovery within shortest possible timeframe. Both FPSO Redeployment and MOPU deployment can involve brownfield modifications, life extension requirements and new process/utility requirements. Due to this unique requirements the right capability and expertise is required to ensure project success.
